Physics is dead.

Not as a tool. As a god.

For 400 years, we treated physics as the final court of appeal on what is real and what isn’t. If it didn’t fit into our current physical picture, it was dismissed as confusion, poetry, or superstition.​

In a new short paper, I argue that this move has quietly failed.

Physics is downstream of mind, and mind is downstream of metaphysics. Before you can even start doing physics, the mind has to supply a minimal “kernel” of primitives: distinction, identity, structure, lawhood, necessity, validity. These aren’t discoveries of physics. They are the conditions under which anything can count as “physical” in the first place.​

That leads to a hard limit:

No physical theory can justify the very primitives it needs to exist.

Any attempt to ground those primitives “in physics” is circular, because the claims of physics only make sense once those primitives are already in play. Physics can refine, extend, and even stress‑test our inherited concepts, but it cannot climb back up the ladder and become its own source.​

In the paper, I call the top layer “magic” – not in the sense of supernatural forces, but in a strict structural sense:

It generates an entire domain of intelligibility,

It cannot be proven from within that domain,

and every attempt to reject it regenerates it in a new form.​

Modern physics, with quantum theory, relativity, and cosmology, has now broken many of the classical assumptions it depended on – about objects, time, and global structure – without any physics‑internal way to rebuild the conceptual kernel it just shattered. At that point, the hidden metaphysics becomes visible again.​

That visibility is what “kills” physics as a final authority. What survives is physics as an extraordinarily powerful technique living inside a deeper architecture built by the mind.​

If you care about science, AI, consciousness, or just what it means to say “this is real,” I think this matters.

I’ve put the argument into an 11‑section note:

“Physics is Dead: Metaphysics, Mind, and the Inescapable Magic at the Top” (February 2026).
